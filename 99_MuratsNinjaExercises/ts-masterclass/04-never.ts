// The type never means that nothing occurs.
// It is used when a type guard cannot occur or in a situation where an exception is always thrown
// A function with return type of never wonâ€™t allow to return undefined / void,
// A function with return type of void allows to return undefined / void

// never is a subtype of every type, so we could just have the return type as : boolean
