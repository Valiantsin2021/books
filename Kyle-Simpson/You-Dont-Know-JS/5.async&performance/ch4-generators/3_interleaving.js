// with generators, clearly interleaving (even in the middle of statements!) is possible:
// You almost certainly wonâ€™t want to intentionally create this level of interleaving confusion, as it creates incredibly difficult to understand code.
// But the exercise is interesting and instructive to understand more about how multiple generators can run concurrently in the same shared scope, because there will be places where this capability is quite useful.
