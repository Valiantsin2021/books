// We can express the three separate steps of the adjacent map(..) calls as a composition of the transformers (elide, upper, removeInvalidChars)
// since they are all unary functions and each returns the value thatâ€™s suitable as input to the next. 
// We can fuse the mapper functions using compose(..), and then pass the composed function to a single map(..) call:

words
  .map(
    compose(elide, upper, removeInvalidChars)
  ); //?

words
  .map(
    pipe(removeInvalidChars, upper, elide)
  ); //?
