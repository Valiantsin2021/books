# Recommended learning path

When starting, I did not get the privilege of deciding which resource would be the best to learn first. Usually I would start a book and realize I do not know the foundational information needed to understand it. For example, you should really know Functional Programming before trying to understand RxJs. 

For a new learner, I would recommend a better approach.

## 1. Really learn JS, and some TS

* You Don't Know JS Series (Kyle Simpson)
* Secrests of the JavaScript Ninja (John Resig and Bear Bibeault)
* Typescript handbook (Basarat Ali Syed)
  
## 2. Learn Functional Programming in JS

* Functional Light JS (Kyle Simpson)
* FP in JS (Luis Antecio)
* A few others that I have not gotten to (Prof Frisbie, JS Allonge)

## 3. After that, you can tackle the front-end or the back-end path. The order depends on your immediate needs.

I only recommended to learn FP & RxJs (Luis Antecio) prior to tackling Angular.

Sprinkle the testing knowledge as you study the back and front end. Jest covers both at unit level. Learn e2e UI testing (Cypress all the way) and API testing (Cypress again!).

## 4. Once you have full stack awareness, start learning devops

* Bash & Linux
* Docker
* AWS
* Learn your preferred CI provider's api by heart
