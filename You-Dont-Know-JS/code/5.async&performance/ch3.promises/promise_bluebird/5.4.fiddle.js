var Promise = require('bluebird');


// none([ .. ]) This pattern is like all([ .. ]), but fulfillments and rejections are transposed. 
  // All Promises need to be rejected â€” rejections become the fulfillment values and vice versa. 

// any([ .. ]) This pattern is like all([ .. ]), but it ignores any rejections, so only one needs to fulfill instead of all of them.

// first([ .. ]) This pattern is like a race with any([ .. ]), which means that it ignores any rejections 
  //and fulfills as soon as the first Promise fulfills. 
  
// last([ .. ]) This pattern is like first([ .. ]), but only the latest fulfillment wins.
