// with generators, clearly interleaving (even in the middle of statements!) is possible:


function* foo() {
  a++;
  a; //?
  b; //?
  yield; //?
  a; //?
  b; //?
  b = b * a;
  a; //?
  b; //?
  a = (yield b) + 3;
  a; //?
  b; //?
}

function *bar() {
  b--;
  yield;
  a = (yield 8) + b;
  b = a * (yield 2);
}

// helper to control the iterator
// initializes a generator to create its it iterator, then returns a function which, when called, advances the iterator by one step.
function step(gen){
  var it = gen();
  var last;

  return function() {
    // whatever is yielded out, send it back the next time
    last = it.next(last).value;
    last; //?
  };
}
// reset a and b
a = 1;
b = 2;

var s1 = step(foo);
var s2 = step(bar);

s2(); // b--
s2(); // yield 8 , last value that step received is 8
s1(); // a++
s2(); // a = 8 + b, yield 2
s1(); // b = b * a, yield b
s1(); // a = b + 3
s2(); // b = a * 2

console.log(a, b);

// You almost certainly wonâ€™t want to intentionally create this level of interleaving confusion, as it creates incredibly difficult to understand code.
// But the exercise is interesting and instructive to understand more about how multiple generators can run concurrently in the same shared scope, because there will be places where this capability is quite useful.
