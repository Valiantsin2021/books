// ch[2.2] connecting a component to Redux.
// Actions are used by container components, which dispatch them to reducers
// you took care of the redux boilerplate (2.0)
// you created the actions & action handlers (2.1) 
// now, at a container component, dispatch those actions 
// the container component has to know about state, so use mapStateToProps
// bridge the component and Redux using connect

// presentational components handle UI and UI-related data (like angular components), ex: TaskPage.js
// container components (App.js) handle application data via Redux (like Angular services).
// container components render presentational components, ex: <TasksPage />
// with this pattern, how the application looks is decoupled from what it does
