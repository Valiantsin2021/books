/* In [2] we used math random to get values and got them every time
In a real-world application, the userâ€™s typos may generate network requests that introduce delays..
while returning data for mistakenly entered values. How would you go about discarding the results of unwanted requests?

switchMap() to the rescue, becaue this operator switches to the latest observable (in the below example 1st observable is what is typed)
and can cancel previous in-flight network requests
it is great for typeahead; we are typing, http.gets are going out, but we typed something wrong
We want the previous in flight request cancelled and we want to switch the most recent request. Of course, we should wait in between...
For the wait, debounceTime() operator is great because it shifts the pipeline by delay amount
and passes only the most recent value from each burst of emissions
